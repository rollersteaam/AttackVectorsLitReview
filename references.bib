# How does someone attack a biometric system? What attack vectors might they use?
The majority of reported biometric system incidents are related to spoofing. Typically security breaches are a result of exploited vulnerabilities (cited). Poor physical security is an easily exploitable attack vector. 

Collusion and cooercion

Spoofing
- Lifted fingerprints or fake fingers (cited)
- Gummy fingers (cited)
- Latex three-dimensional fake fingers (cited)

Replay attacking
Synthesised feature vector 


# How are researchers defending against these attacks?

# What do researchers not know?

# What has been researched and what has not been researched?
Successive representational models that have become increasingly complex. These models decrease in practical application. What does this mean?

# What gaps are there in the knowledge of biometric attack research?
